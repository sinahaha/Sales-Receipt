I solved the first challenge ‚Äì ‚ÄúSALES TAXES‚Äù. For this, I followed the steps:

  1-	Started apersonal  GitHub account (assuming this one! üòâ)
  2-	Created a new Project in Eclipse (Sales-Receipt)
  3-	Added Pom.xml and a few necessary preliminary dependencies
  4-	Added a start java class (com.sina.receipt.Sina.java)
  5-	Converted the project to a Maven repository
  6-	Created the following modules and classes:
    ‚Ä¢ Receipt.java: the reference java class, which conducts the whole process and is run by "Start.java"
      ‚Ä¢ SaleItem.java: Data model for an item on an invoice (used in the entire program)
        ‚Ä¢ TaxRate.java: Delivers the tax rate for an article on the invoice called by "SaleItem.java" (according to whether it is imported and whether it is tax exempt)
      ‚Ä¢ Invoice.java: prepares the invoice and is called by "Receipt.java"
        ‚Ä¢ Input.java: Gets the inputs (purchased article, quantity, price per unit, whether the article is imported and whether the article is tax exempt); called by "Invoice.java"
          ‚Ä¢ Validations.java: Is called by "Input.java" and validates its entries
    ‚Ä¢ Output.java: prepares the invoice and is called by "Receipt.java"
      ‚Ä¢ CalculateTax.java: Calculates the taxed price and the output for the final invoice, used in "Output.java"
        ‚Ä¢ ImportOutput.java: An Enum class to prepare import related part on the invoice, used in "CalculateTax.java"

I tried to keep everything very simple and made a lot of assumptions:
  ‚Ä¢	the user enters the articles name and unit using underscores instead of spaces
  ‚Ä¢	quantity / amount is an integer (no 3.5 Kgr is accepted, but 3)
  ‚Ä¢	and a few more

I kept to the principle of short and self-explanatory classes
I practiced of decoupling.
I implemented via Test-Driven-Development as far as it was related to calculations.
